Script for calculating Brainerd-Robinson coefficients based on tabular count in python

Python for calculating Brainerd-Robinson coefficients based on tabular count. And for sna in ucinet

BR is a city-block metric of similarity (S) that is calculated as:

S=200-(Sum(|Pik=Pjk|)) or BR(x,y)=1-(sum(Pxi-Pyi)/2

where, for all variables (i), P is the total percentage in assemblages x and y. This provides a scale of similarity from 0-1 where 1 is perfect similarity and 0 is no similarity.

File Format: This script is designed to use the *.csv (comma separated value) file format.

Requirements for Running the Script: In order to run this script, you must install the python statistical platform (version 3.6 or later) and the "numpy" package.
